    <h3>Projects Undertaken</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><em><a href="https://github.com/harshit6966/Data-Sciene-Excel-Visualization">Data Science Visualization (Excel) (Oct 2019 - Nov 2019)</a></em></li>
      <p>This was a semester project given by my instructor. In this I took a dataset of a Supermarket from Kaggle.com. And then analysed it using different tools and features of Microsoft Excel.</p>
      <li><em><a href="https://github.com/harshit6966/Scholarship-Management-System">Scholarship Management System (Jan 2018 - Mar 2018)</a></em></li>
      <p>This project was a semester project where in I had to make a Scholarship Calculator especially designed for our university. It takes various inputs according to the different exams you have appeared in and shows the applicable scholarship amount based on the data that you provide.</p>
      <li><em><a href="https://github.com/harshit6966/Navigato-Travels">Tour and Travel Management System (Mar 2017 - May 2017)</a></em></li>
      <p>I made this project keeping in mind the current existing system. In the present era where time proves to be the most important asset for an individual. So, by replacing the current register system to fully computerised one, will not only save time but also accuracy, reliability and uniformity can be maintained.</p>
